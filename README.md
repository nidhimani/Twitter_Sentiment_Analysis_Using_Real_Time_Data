## Snscrape
By using snscrape tweets are scraped from BarackObama twitter account between the dates 2023-01-01 and 2023 - 04- 20 and created a dataframe with the tweets.

## Cleaning testðŸ§¹ðŸ§¹ðŸ§¹

## Treating emojis and emoticons ðŸ˜Ž
Emojis are replaced with text by using emoji package. A dictionary is created with mostly used emoticons like ":), :(" etc and replace with text.

## Tokenization and Lemmatization
TreebankWordTokenizer is used to convert the tweets  into understandable bits of data that a program can work with. WordNetLemmatizer is used to break a word down to its root meaning.

3.CountVectorizer is used to count number of times a word is repeated and then splitted the data into train and test.
